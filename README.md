# Backend Engineering with Go (Golang)

This repository is a **hands-on learning playground** for backend engineering using **Go (Golang)**.

The goal of this repo is to **learn by building** — exploring how real backend services are structured, configured, and run, using Go and common backend tools.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Get hands-on with **backend engineering concepts**
- Learn **idiomatic Go** for backend services
- Experiment with **APIs, configuration, databases, and tooling**
- Build practical knowledge through small, focused implementations

This is **not a production framework** — it’s a personal learning repo.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (growing)

- **Go (Golang)**
- HTTP servers & routing
- Environment-based configuration
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Migrations
- Basic project structure & conventions
